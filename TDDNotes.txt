## Week 0 (02/21)
* I'm starting a TDD program! The book is called "Test-Driven Development with Python". It was
  available for free online reading [here](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754)
* The plan is to spend about 30-45 minutes working on it daily. I need consistency more 
  than I need bursts of effort.
* I went through the intro to the book today. I'll start Chapter One tomorrow.

## Week 1 (02/22)
* Lesson 1: Start coding only when you have developed a test and watched it fail
* *Sunday*: The first test was to determine whether or not Django was installed, so the first
  thing to do was make a file that would only run if Django was installed. The script just
  opened up a browser with Selenium and tried to open localhost:8000. The assert at the end
  would fail if the title of the page didn't have "Django" in it. Once the test failed, I
  ran django-admin.py to initialize a Django app. I ran it, and the test didn't fail!
* This was a nice intro to the TDD arts. It'll be easy to get into the habit of making
  functional tests because they are so similar to the style of coding that I'm familiar with.
